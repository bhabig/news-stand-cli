# NewsStand

Welcome to your brand new news stand! this is an interactive news app which brings the latest content of CNN's US section to your command line. You will be able to read any of the five newest articles from any subcategory of cnn.com/us.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'news_stand'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

To use this app after installation, run './bin/news-stand' in your terminal. From there, follow the instructions to navigate the website. You will be required to enter either a number, the word 'back', or 'exit'. 'back' returns to a previous menu and 'exit' will terminate the session and return you to your command line.

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
